  <h1><b> My assignment.html page for linking to assignment items for your Website Assesment</b></h1>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>This page is the marking guide to your website that your tutor will use to find your elements. Do not name this
    page anything other than assignment.html (all lower case) or else we may not be able to find and mark your
    assignment elements.<span>&nbsp; </span>How to use this page:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Please, link this page to your website's index.html page</li>
    <li>over time, link each assignment task listed below to its location in your website as soon as you have started it
    </li>
    <li>replace the "notes" paragraph with your notes or
      delete if you have no notes - your notes will help us understand and
      mark your site so you should explain things. Maybe you did a task
      differently from the way we specified it, either because your way is
      better (tell us) or minimally or not at all to fit in with your site's
      look and feel (tell us) or ... (also tell us). So, for example, a video
      might spoil the look and feel. What you do is make one anyway, link to
      it from this assessment.html page and explain in the <i>Notes</i> why
      it's not linked to from your public version of your web site. You can
      style this page as your like, so long as you keep the links to the
      assignment tasks.</li>
    <li>provide link to report where indicated</li>
    <li>delete these instructions when you are ready</li>
  </ul>

  <p><a href="about.html">Chinese Intangible Cultural Heritage Website</a></p>
  <p>As a Chinese international student from a country with a history spanning five millennia, I have always been
    captivated
    by the rich tapestry of our country's cultural heritage. It is a legacy that has endured the test of time, passed
    down
    through centuries of change. Motivated by my love for our cultural treasures and a sense of urgency spurred by their
    gradual disappearance, I created a platform dedicated to promoting China's intangible cultural heritage.

    Immersing myself in folk literature, music and dance, traditional drama and storytelling, acrobatics and sports,
    fine
    arts, and traditional medicine, I've curated a comprehensive showcase of these cultural elements on Chinese
    Intangible
    Cultural Heritage Website. Whether it's delving into ancient folklore, experiencing the charm of traditional music,
    or
    witnessing the magic of Chinese theater, my aim is to educate, engage, and ignite a love for intangible cultural
    heritage.

    I work hard to promote China's excellent intangible cultural heritage on my website, hoping to attract more people's
    attention to this excellent culture and attract more people to understand, appreciate and inherit it. I believe that
    through collective efforts we can ensure that these valuable cultural traditions are protected and continue to grow.

    Join us in exploring the richness of China's intangible cultural heritage and in carrying forward our cultural
    legacy!

    I use Javascript to achieve the following functions:
  </p>
  <p>
    1. Display the current date and time:
    After the DOM loads, the script gets the container on the page that displays the current date and time. Get the
    current
    Date and time through the 'date' object and format it in a localized string format. The formatted date and time are
    then
    displayed in the container.
  </p>

  <p>
    2.Handle email subscriptions:
    The script listens for subscription form submission events. When the form is submitted, the script validates the
    format
    of the E-mail input. If the format is invalid, the form submission is blocked and an error message is displayed. If
    the
    format is valid, the script sends a POST request to the '/subscribe' endpoint through the Fetch API, sending a
    subscription request that includes an email. Depending on the result of the request, the script displays the
    corresponding subscription success or failure message and handles possible network errors.
  </p>
  <p>
    3. Slider system:
    The script switches the slide between two content blocks by listening for the click event of the left and right
    scroll
    buttons. It adjusts the current slider index and updates the 'transform' style of the content container based on the
    index to slide it to the desired position.
  </p>
  <p>
    4. Initialize the gallery and switch images automatically:
    In each gallery section, the script sets a timer to switch to the next image every 3 seconds. It hides the currently
    displayed image, increases the index to the next image, and displays the next image (by removing the hidden class),
    making the image loop. This implements a circular slide show within the gallery section.
  </p>
  <p>
    5. Provide validation for form submissions:
    Verify fields such as name, email address, gender, feedback, etc
  </p>
  <p>
    6. Video playback control function:
    Play, pause, mute, or cancel a video
  </p>

  <p>I designed a news section for the website (Chinese Intangible Cultural Heritage) to showcase the latest news,
    activities
    and features related to China's intangible cultural heritage.
    I hope that this news column will not only be a gathering place for information, but also an interactive platform,
    so
    that visitors can learn about the dynamics of intangible cultural heritage in a timely manner and participate in the
    protection and inheritance.
    In addition, I hope that in the future, it can also provide a platform for experts and scholars to share research
    results and discuss protection strategies, and further promote the in-depth development of intangible cultural
    heritage
    protection.</p>
